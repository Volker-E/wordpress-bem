== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What is BEM? =
BEM (block__element--modifier) is a CSS naming convention aimed at producing scalable, modular and decoupled CSS code. There are other people out there who can explain this development methodology a lot more clearly and concisely than me. I particularly suggest reading [Harry Roberts' blog post on the topic](http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/) for a gentle introduction.

= What about foo bar? =
Answer to foo bar dilemma.

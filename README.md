#BEM for WordPress

A plugin that hooks into natively generated WordPress template code and converts class names to block__element--modifier (BEM) notation.

##What is BEM?

BEM (block__element--modifier) is a CSS naming convention aimed at producing scalable, modular and decoupled CSS code. There are other people out there who can explain this development methodology a lot more clearly and concisely than me. I particularly suggest reading [Harry Roberts' blog post on the topic](http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/) for a gentle introduction.

##Who should use this plugin?

If you already use (or want to use) BEM notation in your WordPress projects but are put off or held back by default class names generated by WordPress template tags.

##Examples

	<?php
	
	// native WP template tag that generates HTML
	
	wp_nav_menu(array(
		'theme_location' => 'header',
		'menu_class'     => 'main-menu',
	));
	
	// before BEM conversion
	
	<li class="menu-item current-menu-item menu-item-123">Home</li>
	
	// after
	
	<li class="main-menu__menu-item main-menu__menu-item--current main-menu__menu-item--123">Home</li>

##Limitations & known issues

There is no universally accepted BEM standard: each developer may have his or her own individual style. I've made this plugin according to the way I like to write code. Sorry if this isn't exactly how you would have made it. Nevertheless, suggestions and criticisms are welcome.

This plugin should only really be used by developers creating a WordPress theme from scratch. Installing it on a site with an existing theme is likely to break the frontend.

As BEM for WordPress hooks into native WordPress functions and alters code on the fly, it may overwrite – or be overwritten by – class names generated by existing plugin or theme code.

This plugin is a work in progress, meaning some template tags may have been overlooked during development. If you spot a template tag that this plugin is yet to BEM-ify, please raise an issue and I'll fix it as soon as I can.

Bear in mind that some template tags are harder than others to alter. Particularly `comment_form()`, which directly outputs predefined class names to the browser without exposing any hooks to change its behaviour. That was a fun one to override.

In the list below, I've documented each and every function that this plugin will affect.

##Supported template tags

	wp_nav_menu()
	comment_form()
	body_class()
	post_class()
	wp_list_categories()
